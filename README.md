# res-switch üñ•Ô∏è

A lightweight Windows display resolution switcher with a WPF GUI. Quickly switch between common display resolutions with a single click or keyboard shortcut. Supports custom resolutions via configuration file.

**üîç Pure PowerShell - No executables**: This tool is a single PowerShell script with no compiled binaries or external dependencies. All code is fully transparent and auditable - you can read exactly what it does before running it. No installation required, just PowerShell (built into Windows).

## üí° Motivation

I created this tool to solve a specific problem: when I need to use 1280x1024 resolution for certain games on my primary monitor, allowing the game to switch to that resolution causes all windows and applications on my secondary monitor to get offset and pushed off-screen. This tool provides a quick way to switch resolutions first without disrupting my multi-monitor setup.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**: This software modifies your display settings. While it includes safety checks and tests resolution compatibility before applying changes, I am not responsible for any issues that may occur to your monitor, display settings, or computer system. All resolution changes can be reverted through Windows Display Settings if needed.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Simple Dark Theme GUI** - Simple, clean interface built with WPF

  - Default: Gaming Mode (1280 x 1024)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - Press `1-9` - Switch to corresponding resolution
  - Press `ESC` - Close the application
- **Current Resolution Display** - Shows your current resolution and refresh rate
- **Dynamic UI** - Interface adjusts to show configured resolutions

## üöÄ Quick Start (Remote Execution)

Run directly from PowerShell without downloading:

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanlewis/res-switch/main/res-switch.ps1 | iex
```

## üì¶ Installation

### Method 1: Clone and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryanlewis/res-switch.git
cd res-switch

# Run via batch file (easiest)
.\res-switch.bat

# Or run directly with PowerShell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File res-switch.ps1
```

### Method 2: Download Script Only

```powershell
# Download the script
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanlewis/res-switch/main/res-switch.ps1" -OutFile "res-switch.ps1"

# Run it
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File res-switch.ps1
```

### Method 3: Create Desktop Shortcut

If you've cloned the repository, you can create a convenient desktop shortcut:

```bash
# Run the shortcut creator
.\create-shortcut.cmd
```

This creates a desktop shortcut with:
- Monitor icon
- Direct PowerShell execution (bypasses execution policy)
- Hidden console window for cleaner experience

## üéÆ Usage

1. Launch the application using any of the methods above
2. The GUI will display your current resolution at the top
3. Click on any resolution button to switch, or use keyboard shortcuts (1-9)
4. The active resolution is highlighted in blue
5. Status messages appear at the bottom for feedback
6. Press ESC or close the window to exit

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application supports custom resolutions via a PowerShell Data file (PSD1). By default, it includes 4K, 1080p, and 1280x1024 resolutions.

### Creating a Custom Configuration

1. Copy the example configuration file:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item res-switch.psd1.example res-switch.psd1
   ```

2. Edit `res-switch.psd1` with your preferred resolutions:
   ```powershell
   @{
       Resolutions = @(
           @{
               Name = "5K Ultrawide"
               Width = 5120
               Height = 1440
               Shortcut = "1"  # Optional: keyboard shortcut
           },
           @{
               Name = "QHD"
               Width = 2560
               Height = 1440
               Shortcut = "2"
           },
           # Add more resolutions as needed (up to 9)
       )
   }
   ```

3. The script will automatically load your configuration on next run

### Configuration Locations

The script looks for configuration files in this order:
1. Same directory as the script: `res-switch.psd1`
2. User profile: `%USERPROFILE%\.res-switch\res-switch.psd1`
3. If no config found, uses built-in defaults

### Remote Execution with Configuration

When running remotely, the script will use default resolutions unless you have a configuration file in your user profile directory.

## üîß Technical Details

### Architecture

The application uses:
- **PowerShell** as the scripting engine
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Framework)** for the GUI
- **P/Invoke** to call Windows Display APIs (`user32.dll`)
- **WMI** as the primary method for resolution detection with P/Invoke fallback

### How It Works

1. Queries current display settings using WMI (`Win32_VideoController`)
2. Uses `ChangeDisplaySettings` from `user32.dll` for resolution changes
3. Tests resolution compatibility with `CDS_TEST` flag before applying
4. Updates the registry to make changes persistent (`CDS_UPDATEREGISTRY`)

### File Structure

```
res-switch/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ res-switch.psd1.example # Example configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ res-switch.bat          # Batch launcher (bypasses execution policy)

## üíª System Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (Windows 7/8 may work but untested)
- **PowerShell 5.0** or higher (comes with Windows 10+, required for Import-PowerShellDataFile)
- **.NET Framework 4.5** or higher (for WPF)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- The script uses Windows built-in APIs only
- No external dependencies or network requests (except for remote execution)
- Resolution changes are tested before applying to prevent display issues
- All changes are reversible through Windows Display Settings

## üêõ Known Issues

- Some laptops may not support all resolutions depending on hardware
- Multiple monitor setups currently affect only the primary display
- Custom refresh rates are not yet supported (uses display default)

## üìù TODO

- [ ] Support for multiple monitors
- [ ] Remember user preferences
- [ ] Add refresh rate configuration option
- [ ] System tray integration for quick access
